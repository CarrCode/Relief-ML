# ReliefML

**NewsML** is a news exchange format standardized by the **International Press Telecommunications Council** (IPTC). Leading news organizations use NewsML to package news stories and story metadata into machine readable XML. **SportsML** is a NewsML child format developed for packaging and sharing sports scores, statistics and related information that has become an important data source useful for powering sports related applications.

**ReliefML** is an XML format under development comparable to SportsML. It's designed to give humanitarian actors and journalists specialized NewsML elements and attributes to use to report basic humanitarian situational information as news and package the information into machine readable **needs assessments**.

ReliefML is intended to be compatible with **IATI**, an independent exchange format created by the humanitarian community for packaging information on humanitarian aid activities, transactions and results. Humanitarian actors and journalists will be able to use ReliefML and the same XML to embed situational information into NewsML or IATI files.

## Objectives

ReliefML is a microproject developed by members of the [Humanitarian AI](https://www.meetup.com/Humanitarian-AI-Meetup/) meetup group. The project is interested in how needs assessment information rich in qualitative and quantitative detail can be **packaged**, **made available** to artificial intelligent applications and **used** to help answer complex queries about humanitarian crises, needs in the field and aid activities.

Objective-wise, the project is particularly interested in establishing, through test-traversing different combinations of elements and attributes linking IATI and ReliefML, a core **XML Schema** for ReliefML optimized to contextualize humanitarian aid activities and support informational processing by AI applications.
